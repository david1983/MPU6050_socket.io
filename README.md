# MPU6050_socket.io
Socket.io + AngularJS + Arduino + MPU6050

###Materials
1x Arduino
1x MPU6050 6DOF sensor
Jumper wires
USB cable

###Libraries
serialport
socket.io

###Proof of concept
Using the serialport library for nodeJS we can read the values generated by the MPU6050 and transmitted as a CSV line.
We can then serial the CSV string into an object and send the object through socket.io to a webpage, 
the webpage can then print the yaw, pitch, roll value and generate a 3d animation using CSS 3d transformation;
